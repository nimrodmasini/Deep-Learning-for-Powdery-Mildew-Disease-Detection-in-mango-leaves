# Deep-Learning-for-Powdery-Mildew-Disease-Detection-in-mango-leaves
This project leverages Deep Learning to detect Powdery Mildew disease in mango leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on an image dataset of healthy and infected leaves, enabling automated early disease detection to support farmers in managing crop health.
